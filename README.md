# FlipperZero-Project
In this repository I demonstrate the use of an evil portal on a flipper zero



# Project Overview
The "Evil Portal" project showcases a type of phishing attack known as an Evil Portal hack. This attack involves creating a malicious or fake Wi-Fi network to deceive users and steal their login credentials. The project highlights the potential risks associated with connecting to unsecure public Wi-Fi networks and demonstrates how attackers can exploit them.



# Project Goals
I chose this project to illustrate how easily and rapidly a fake Wi-Fi network can be set up using the Flipper Zero. The project aims to raise awareness about the risks posed by insecure public Wi-Fi networks and to emphasize the importance of security-conscious behavior among users.
